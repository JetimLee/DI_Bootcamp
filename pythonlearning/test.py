print(round(3.1))
print(round(3.5))
print(abs(-20)) #returns absolute value of the argument - no negative numbers

#operator precedence, Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally
float #a float takes up a lot more space in memory than an integer. a float is anything with a decimal in it
bool #boolean true/false
str #all letters
list
tuple
set
dict
complex #a complex number is a 3rd type of number - this is for really really complex math
bin(5) #will return whatever the binary version of 5 is
print(bin(5)) #when python sees 0b, python knows it's a binary number
#can convert it
print(int('0b101',2)) #binary numbers are always a base 2 number, so the conversion is being done here

None #means nothing - abscence of value
