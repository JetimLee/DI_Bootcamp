// In this exercise, you have to decide which type of variables you have to use:

// Create a global variable called bankAmount which value is the amount of money currently in your account.
// Create a variable that saves the % amount of VAT (In Israel, itâ€™s 17%).
// Create an array with all your monthly expenses - both positive and negative (money made and money spent).
// Example : let details = ["+200", "-100", "+146", "+167", "-2900"]
// Create a program that modifies the expenses so that they will include taxes (multiply each expense by the VAT).
// Display your current bankAccount standing at the end of the month.

let bankAmount = 50000;

let moneyStuff = ["+200", "-300", "+8", "+100"];
